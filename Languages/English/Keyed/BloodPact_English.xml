  <BloodPact_Setting_Animal_Title>Allow blood pacts with animals</BloodPact_Setting_Animal_Title>
  <BloodPact_Setting_Animal_Desc>Your colonists can make blood pacts with tamed animals. The pact power will be based on the presence (or absence) of a Bond between the two, but will be on the low side.
As some animals are fairly strong (Thrumbo), this might create some unbalance.</BloodPact_Setting_Animal_Desc>
  <BloodPact_Setting_Prisoner_Title>Recruit prisoners with blood pact</BloodPact_Setting_Prisoner_Title>
  <BloodPact_Setting_Prisoner_Desc>Prisoners may be forced into your colony by creating a blood pact between them and one of your colonist. They might be quite unhappy about it though.</BloodPact_Setting_Prisoner_Desc>
  <BloodPact_Setting_Revolt_Title>Allow pawn revolt</BloodPact_Setting_Revolt_Title>
  <BloodPact_Setting_Revolt_Desc>Involved pawns may botch a blood pact ritual by going berserk if they strongly oppose to it. If they're not able to revolt (option is disabled, or downed pawns) they will get a strong mood debuff instead.
 - colonists: based on mood, and opinion of the other pawn
 - prisoner: based on (improved) recruit chance, which also involves opinion and mood.
 - animals: based on Bond. An animal have the most chance to revolt when the colonist it shares a bond with is not the one involved in the blood pact</BloodPact_Setting_Revolt_Desc>
  <BloodPact_Setting_Tendable_Title>Pact shared damage needs tending</BloodPact_Setting_Tendable_Title>
  <BloodPact_Setting_Tendable_Desc>When damage is shared through a blood pact, the shared part will bleed and need tending.</BloodPact_Setting_Tendable_Desc>
